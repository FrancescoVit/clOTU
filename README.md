# clOTU

Basic idea for this function is to substitute the classical barplot representation of microbial abundance when low numbers (1-2) samples are considered. It was designed for the analysis of microbiome data obtained after NGS sequencing, which were analyzed through the QIIME pipeline, and which are handled in R through phyloseq package.

clOTU is still very beta, it is quite slow and plotting is still far from optimal.
